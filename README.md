## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As a current student passionate about web development, I am seeking an internship to apply my skills and deepen my expertise. With a solid background in HTML, CSS, MySQL, PHP, Angular, Symfony, and object-oriented programming, I am excited about taking on new challenges and actively contributing to innovative projects.

I am motivated by the opportunity to work within a dynamic team and participate in the development of high-performing and creative web solutions. If you are looking for a determined and curious intern, I would be delighted to discuss potential collaboration opportunities with you.
